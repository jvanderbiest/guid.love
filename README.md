# GUID.❤️
## Introduction
This sample application uses the Blazor framework to run the System.GUID assembly from Microsoft in the browser.
The initial idea was to have a static deployment, so everything would run on the client. This worked fine but you miss out on SEO, so I've added a Blazor server side implementation afterwards and deployed it on an Azure App service instance.
